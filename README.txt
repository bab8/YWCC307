My Presentation is about navigation and pathfinding,
from Google Maps to Mouse in a Maze, my presentation discusses
all forms of pathfinding algorithmns and how they work. Specifically
the presetation focuses on state space search and how it can be expanded to form
all other pathfinding algorithmns such as A*. Finally, the presentation
concludes with discussion on the ways that pathfinding and navigation 
can be improved.
